# Cactus Classification

This project demonstrates the use of a deep learning model (ResNet50) for classifying cactus species based on image data. It utilizes the PyTorch library for model training and evaluation. The dataset consists of three cactus species: **Astrophytum asteria**, **Ferocactus**, and **Gymnocalycium**.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of different cactus species, and each species corresponds to a specific label. The images are used to train a model that can classify new images into one of these categories.

### Classes:
- **Astrophytum asteria**
- **Ferocactus**
- **Gymnocalycium**

## Installation
Before running the project, make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install torchmetrics
pip install torchinfo
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn opencv-python tqdm
